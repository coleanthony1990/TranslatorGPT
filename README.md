### Simple Translation Application ###
I used [OpenAi API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference) to make a simple translator app. The api is really fun to work with and obviously has way more capabilities than what this app is using it for. 

## Usage ##
If you'd like to play around with the code, fork and clone this repo. You will need to go to the openAI docs and get an API Key for yourself. Plug that into an env. file and get going!
